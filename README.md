# Overview

It is a simple C++ program. It includes the input/output library (iostream), and in the main function simply prints out "Hello World" to the terminal.

This was simply to get started with the C++ language. 


# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code. I have the C/C++ extensions installed and used the Code Runner extension so I don't have to leave VSC to run the program.

I used C++ to create this program.
